          <h2>Why should you read this document?</h2>
          <p>
            During the course of dealing with us, we will ask you to provide us
            with detailed personal information relating to your existing
            circumstances, your financial situation and, in some cases, your
            health and family health history (“Your Personal Data”). This
            document explains what we will need to do with Your Personal Data
            and the various rights you have in relation to it.
          </p>

          {/* What do we mean by “Your Personal Data”? */}
          <h2>What do we mean by “Your Personal Data”?</h2>
          <p>
            Your Personal Data means any information describing or relating to
            your circumstances. It may identify you directly (for example, your
            name, address, date of birth or national insurance number) or
            indirectly (for example, information about your employment and
            financial situation, or your health).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of providing you with assistance in relation to your
            secured loan, remortgage, finance and/or insurance requirements,
            Your Personal Data may include (but is not limited to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Title, name, date of birth, gender, nationality, civil/marital
              status, contact details, addresses and documents that are
              necessary to verify your identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Employment and remuneration information (including salary/bonus
              schemes/overtime/sick pay/other benefits) and employment history.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bank account details, tax information, loans and credit
              commitments, personal credit history, sources of income and
              expenditure, family circumstances and details of dependants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Health status and history, details of treatment and prognosis, and
              medical reports where relevant to the products or services we
              arrange for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any pre-existing mortgage/finance and/or insurance products and
              the terms and conditions relating to these.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Basis upon which we will deal with data */}
          <h2>The basis upon which our firm will deal with Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            When we speak with you about your secured loan, remortgage, finance
            and/or insurance requirements, we do so on the basis that both
            parties are entering into a contract for the supply of services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to perform that contract, and to arrange the products you
            require, we have the right to use Your Personal Data for the
            purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use Your Personal Data where it is in our legitimate
            business interests to do so and where your rights are not affected.
            For example, we may need to respond to requests from lenders,
            insurance providers or our compliance service provider in relation
            to the advice we have given to you, or to seek your feedback on the
            service you received.
          </p>
          <p>
            On occasion, we will use Your Personal Data to meet our contractual
            or regulatory responsibilities to, for example, the Financial
            Conduct Authority or other legal or regulatory bodies.
          </p>

          {/* Special data */}
          <h2>The basis upon which we will process certain parts of Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            Where you ask us to assist you with, for example, your insurance
            needs (particularly life insurance or insurance that may assist you
            in the event of accident or illness), we may need to collect and use
            information about your health, your medical history or your ethnic
            origin (“Special Category Data”).
          </p>
          <p>
            We will record and use your Special Category Data only where it is
            necessary for us to make enquiries of insurance providers, assess
            the suitability of products for your needs and provide you with
            advice and guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have parental responsibility for children under the age of
            13, it is also likely that we will record information on our systems
            that relates to those children and, potentially, to their Special
            Category Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will treat Special Category Data and any information relating to
            criminal convictions or offences (“Criminal Disclosures”) in the
            same way as Your Personal Data generally, as set out in this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          {/* Collection */}
          <h2>How do we collect Your Personal Data?</h2>
          <p>
            We will collect and record Your Personal Data from various sources,
            mainly directly from you. You will usually provide information
            during our initial meetings or conversations to establish your
            circumstances, needs and preferences concerning secured
            loan/remortgage/finance and/or insurance. You will provide
            information to us verbally and in writing, including by email.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also obtain some information from third parties, for example
            from credit checks, employers, other professional advisers, or from
            searches of information in the public domain such as the electoral
            roll. We use technology solutions to assist in collecting Your
            Personal Data, for example software that can verify your credit
            status. We will only do this where we have obtained the appropriate
            consent or where we are otherwise permitted to do so by law.
          </p>

          {/* What happens to data */}
          <h2>What happens to Your Personal Data when it is disclosed to us?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Record and store Your Personal Data in paper files, mobile
              devices, and our computer systems (including email, hard drives
              and cloud facilities). This information can only be accessed by
              employees and consultants within our firm and only when it is
              necessary to provide our service to you or to perform
              administrative tasks associated with that service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit Your Personal Data to product providers, mortgage lenders,
              commercial lenders and/or insurance providers, both in paper form
              and online via secure portals, where this is essential in allowing
              us to progress any enquiry or application made on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use Your Personal Data for the purposes of responding to any
              queries you may have in relation to any secured
              loan/remortgage/finance and/or insurance policy you may take out,
              or to let you know of any developments in relation to those
              products and/or policies of which we might become aware.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Sharing */}
          <h2>Sharing Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            From time to time Your Personal Data will be shared with:

            <li>
              Investment providers, finance lenders, mortgage lenders, insurance
              providers, subsidiaries and partner companies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third parties who we believe will be able to assist us with your
              enquiry or application, or who are able to support your needs as
              identified. These may include, but are not limited to, compliance
              advisers, product specialists, estate agents, providers of legal
              services such as conveyancers, surveyors and valuers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In each case, Your Personal Data will only be shared for the
            purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, i.e. to progress your
            finance/remortgage and/or insurance enquiry and to provide you with
            our professional services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not envisage that the performance by us of our service will
            involve Your Personal Data being transferred outside of the European
            Economic Area.

          <p>
            We also expect you to take reasonable steps to safeguard your own
            privacy when transferring information to us, such as not sending

            attachments are password-protected or encrypted where appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
